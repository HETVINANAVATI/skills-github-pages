A blog is a type of website or online platform where individuals or groups regularly post articles, commentary, or other types of content. The word "blog" is a shortened form of "weblog." Blogs typically feature entries or posts displayed in reverse chronological order, with the most recent content appearing at the top.

Blogs can cover a wide range of topics, including personal experiences, hobbies, travel, food, fashion, technology, politics, and more. They allow authors, often referred to as bloggers, to share their thoughts, expertise, or creative work with a potentially large audience.

The format of a blog post can vary, but it often includes a title, date, and the main body of the content. Bloggers may include images, videos, hyperlinks, and other multimedia elements to enhance their posts. Blogs typically offer readers the ability to leave comments and engage in discussions, fostering a sense of community and interaction.

Some blogs are maintained by individuals as personal journals or platforms for self-expression, while others are created by professionals, organizations, or businesses to share information, promote products or services, or establish thought leadership in a particular field. Blogs have become an important part of online media, providing diverse perspectives and valuable content for readers around the world.
